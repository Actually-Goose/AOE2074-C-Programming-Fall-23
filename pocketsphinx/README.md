This project utilizes the PocketSphinx speech recognition engine to enable real-time speech-to-text functionality, 
allowing users to control a drone using voice commands. The project incorporates a keyphrase.txt file to 
define specific keywords that trigger drone actions.
To make compiling easier, we installed Pocketsphinx and portaudio system-wide.
